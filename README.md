# Local economic inequality in the UK

This repo contains the code and data for an interactive map of local inequality in the United Kingdom: https://jhsuss.shinyapps.io/uk-local-inequality/

The data was collected for this paper: [*Measuring local, salient economic inequality in the UK*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0308518X231154255) and includes neighbourhood-level inequality estimates -- see below an example for London (at the Lower Super Output Area).
